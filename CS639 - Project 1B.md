# Project 1B: "Battleship" in Vyper

This is the second part of the first project. You can find the first part [here](https://gist.github.com/darkryder/5867120aebc727acd36d20f2fd0e8858).

For this part of the project you need to create a simplified version of the game "Battleship" as a smart contract.
Take a look at the detailed description [here](https://github.com/kaimast/btech-miniprojects/tree/main/battleship).

Before you start, make sure you understand what a smart contract is and that you have a basic understanding of the Vyper syntax.
If not, review [Vyper's documentation](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/index.html).

## Not a Group Project

You are supposed to complete this project by yourself.

It is fine to talk about Vyper and smart contracts in general with other students, but you cannot share code.

## Turn in
The project is **due on Monday, 2/13**.

Once you are done, copy all code to your handin folder. Your handin folder's path folllows the following pattern `/p/course/{SECTION}-kaimast/handin/{LOGIN}/p1b`.

For example, if you are enrolled in CS839 and your CS Login is `kai`, the path would be `/p/course/cs839-kaimast/handin/kai/p1b`.

## Verifying your Submission
Make sure the tests still pass once it is copied over and that you have not changed the `test_battleship.py` file.
You can run the tests on the CSL machines like so `python3 -m pytest`.

We will grade your project using the tests provided. There are no hidden tests.
